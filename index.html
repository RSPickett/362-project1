          <dd class="river-description">The Nantahala is the classic southeastern river for entry level whitewater. Its safe to say that the Nantahala is one of the most rafted streams in the country. Its probably safe to say that more beginners have swum while learning on this river than most others.</dd>
          <dd class="river-description">The majority of the run is cold, splashy class two water. Nantahala falls is the class three exception to the rule. Pattons Run, the first rapid just around the corner from the put-in, sometimes gives beginners a hard time.</dd>
          <dd class="river-description">The Nantahala's most notable feature is its dam-controlled, cold water. Figure about 45 degrees. The river usually runs 7 days a week, except for the month of November when the dam is taken off line for maintenence. Call Duke Energy to see if the river is running.</dd>
          <dd class="river-description">The river is completely roadside along US 19 and US 74 about an hour west of Asheville, between Bryson City and Andrews, North Carolina. The Forest Service maintains the put-in. The take-out is behind the Nantahala Outdoor Center on river left. NOC maintains a large parking area. </dd>

          <dd class="river-description">The Nolichucky is in an incredibly beautiful, deep, mountain gorge that offers lots of great play, especially within the first few miles. The Noli's punch is at the beginning, then it mellows out to a mostly class III run allowing ample opportunity to enjoy the scenery. The gorge is remote with the only opportunity to walk out by a railroad track that parallels the river.</dd>

        <!-- <div class="for-background"/> -->
          <dd class="river-description">The Upper Tellico, also known as the "Ledges" section, is only two miles in length, but the significant whitewater makes it seem longer. A parallel road makes scouting and shuttling easy and this section can be run several times in one day. The Upper Tellico has great scenery, great water, and good drops. This is a classic southeastern whitewater--please don't take this gem for granted!</dd>

        </section>
        <!-- <div class="for-background"/> -->
          <dd class="river-description">This stretch is hardly ever paddled, but is a great novice run with a few spots that will certainly challenge newer boaters. There are a plethora of class 2-2+ rapids with fun moves to make as well as a handfull of class 3 rapids that are quite nice. Combine that with several tight and suprisingly picturesque gorges and you have a great canoe/kayak trip. The best part about this run is that it can be paddled down to around 500cfs on the new gauge described above. 800cfs is a good level and 1000-1200 will be a little juicier but not really any harder. (Ed note - the gauge referred to is no longer in service - not sure how to convert to the current gauge)</dd>

        </section>
        <!-- <div class="for-background"/> -->
          <dd class="river-description">Section 9 of the French Broad (known widely as FB9) has historically meant from the Madison County put-in in Barnard to one of the take outs in Hot Springs. Probably 90%+ of all trips on FB9 are from Barnard to Stackhouse. Maybe I should call this section 9A. The reasons for this are fairly simple; from Barnard to Stackhouse the river has fairly evenly dispersed class 2 and 3 rapids and the run is consistent. If you paddle below Stackhouse, you paddle 4 miles of mostly flatwater for 2 good rapids, class 3 Kayak Ledge and Class 4 Frank Bell's. Most paddlers comfortable on class 4 probably don't think it worth the price.</dd>
